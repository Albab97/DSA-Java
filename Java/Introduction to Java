~ Java is an open source technology used for developing platform independent applications.
~ Developed by James Gosling at Sun Micro Systems in 1995.
~ Java platform consists of two essential software : JDK and JRE.
~ JDK (Java Development Kit) : It is a program development environment for writing Java applets and applications.
    Components of JDK : JRE(Java Runtime Environment), JVM(Java Virtual Machine), compiler(javac), other
    development tools.
~ JRE (Java Runtime Environment) : It is a part of JDK which provides different tools for running Java application
    (it does not include development tools like a compiler)
    Components of JRE : JVM(Java Virtual Machine), Java Libraries (core APIs), other support files needed to execute
    Java program.
~ Java Compiler (javac) : .java programs are converted to an intermediary code called byte code with the help of java
    compiler. Byte code is platform independent and can run on any operating system (having JDK). This is why Java is
    called Platform Independent language (Write once, Run anywhere).
~ JVM (Java Virtual Machine) : It is a crucial part of Java ecosystem that allows to run Java programs on any
    operating system. It executes Java bytecode(.class) and converts it to machine specific instructions for host
    system. It consists of ClassLoader (loads compiled .class files to memory), Interpreter (which converts byte
    code into machine code line by line), JIT(Just in time) compiler (optimize frequently used codes).
