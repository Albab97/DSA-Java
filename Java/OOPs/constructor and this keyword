Constructor:
A constructor defines what occurs when an object of a class is created. It is a special type of function which is called
every time a new object is created. It has the same name as that of the class to which it belongs to. If it is not
defined inside the class then it is called a by default constructor (with no arguements). But if it is defined inside
the class then it is mandatory to invoke it with the required arguements.

Constructors look a little strange because they have no return type, not even void.This is because the implicit return
type of a classâ€™ constructor is the class type itself.

Student student1 = new Student();
Here, student1 is a variable of the Student type being created. The Student is the name of the class that is being
instantiated. The class name,i.e. Student() followed by parentheses is calling the constructor for the class.

 The this Keyword:
 Sometimes a method will need to refer to the object that invoked it. To allow this, Java defines the this keyword.
 this can be used inside any method to refer to the current object. That is, this is always a reference to the object on
 which the method was invoked.
